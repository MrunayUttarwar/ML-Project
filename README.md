Sentiment Analysis Using Transformer Embeddings & Machine Learning Models
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores sentiment analysis using DeBERTa transformer embeddings combined with traditional and ensemble machine learning models. The study compares the performance of various ML models in sentiment classification and analyzes their limitations in handling negations and nuanced expressions.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used in this study contains labeled text samples with positive and negative sentiments. It is preprocessed and transformed into DeBERTa embeddings before being fed into machine learning models.

ðŸ“Š Models Used
We trained and evaluated the following models:

Traditional Models

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Ensemble Models

XGBoost

CatBoost

LightGBM

The models were trained on DeBERTa embeddings extracted from text samples.
